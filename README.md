# ❤️ Beating Heart

This is one of my early CSS projects where I created a **heart shape** that continuously beats using CSS animations.  
This was a practice project to explore **CSS transformations**, **keyframes**, and **animations**.

##  Features

- CSS-based heart shape (no images).
- Beat animation (scales in and out).
- Lightweight, no external libraries or JavaScript.
